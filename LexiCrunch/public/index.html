      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

          <p>You are given 20 letter tiles at the start of the game. You must make a word from 
            the 10 tiles in the bottom row. The top row is not available for use but is visible. 
            Once a valid word has been submitted, the top row will move down and can be used to 
            make the next word. A new top row will come down from off-screen. You will have 1 
            minute to make up to 10 words, 1 word per row of letter tiles. You will be scored 
            based on the length and novelty of the word you have submitted. Once you have made   
            10 words, or when the timer expires, whichever comes first, the game is over. Click 
            the button below to clear these instructions and play the game.</p>
