b"Baskoro  et al./ Innovation to improve critical thinking skills in Generation Z  / JTI, Vol. 25, No. 2., December 20 23, pp.121-130 \n122 Efforts related to improving CT skills have been carried out in several studies using various methods. However, \nimproving CT skills specifically aimed at Gen Z with its unique characteristics is still necessary in the current \nconditions. Therefore, this pa per aims to elaborate on a method to improve Gen Z competence in CT skills that \nare in tune with Gen Z\xe2\x80\x99s characteristics and utilize peeragogy approaches combined with artificial intelligence \n(AI). This paper not only discusses the use of AI in education, such as to improve CT skills but also provides \nawareness regarding the possible impacts of using AI unthinkingly, which can have ethical implications  [6]. \n \nMethod s \nThe methodology used in this paper is a literature study that is directly related to the topic. In addition, this \npaper also develops a method to achieve the objective. The method is to adopt 7E learning cycles and peeragogy \nas a learning approach combined  with using artificial intelligence/AI as a tool (Figure 1). Another methodology \nused in this paper is action research, where this method is applied directly to the teac hing and learning process \nin the classroom at a higher education institution . \n \n \nFigure 1. Method to achieve competence of critical t hinking  \n \nGeneration  \n \nGenerations represent a distinct and separate group of people with a standard set of beliefs, experiences, and \nvalues about how the world works. Generations are individuals who live in the same period and have the same \nage, year of birth, and similar events in the lives of these individual groups  [7]. In the characterization of \ngenerations based on the year of birth, according to Tracy Francis and Fernanda Hoefel  [8], at least we already \nknow some of them: Baby boomers (1940 -1959), Gen X (1960 -1979), Gen Y/Millennial (1980 -1994), Gen Z (1995 -\n2010). There are several characteristics of each of these generations, the most prominent being mastery of IT, \ninternet, use of gadgets, and active use of social media such as SMS, email, BBM, WhatsApp, Line, Facebook, \nInstagram, online applications, etc . [9]\xe2\x80\x93[14]. \n \nGeneration Z (Gen Z)  \n \nIn this paper, we will specifically discuss Gen Z, born between 1995 and 2010 and currently aged between 13 \nand 28. This generation was born when IT and digital technology i nnovation and development experienced \nmuch progress. Not surprisingly, they were born and developed in a social environment heavily influenced by \nIT technology's use in everyday life. Due to the influence of environmental developments, including but not \nlimited to technology, this generation has specific characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses compared to other \ngenerations. Generation Z is also known in many references with other terms such as iGeneration, net generation  \nor internet generation, post -millennials, Facebook generation, digital natives, switchers, dotcom children, C -\nconnection \xe2\x80\x93generation, D -digital \xe2\x80\x93generation, and R -responsibility \xe2\x80\x93generation . \n \nCharacteristics of Generation Z  \n \nSome of the distinctive characteristics of Gen Z, as conveyed by Singh and Dangmei  [9] among others, are tend \nto be impatient, have an instant way of thinking, lack ambition, have symptoms of ADHD (Attention Deficit \nHyperactivity Disorder), especially attention deficit with high dependence on technology, individualistic, self -\n"
