This is where I store all of my Computer Science Projects that I have created over the course of being a Computer Science Major.

Descriptions for notable projects:

1. Data Structures: Contains all of my programs that have a heavy emphasis on creating and using data structures.
2. COSC 2325: Contains programs that were coded in the assembly language MIPS.
3. Lexi Crunch: Lexi Crunch is a word game that requires players to think of as many words from a group of 100 letters as possible in a 60 second time frame. It was coded using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. 
4. PDF Reader: Converts all of the PDF files in the Research Paper folder from PDFs to text files.
