This is where I store all of my Computer Science Projects I have created throughout my time as a Computer Science Major.

Descriptions for notable projects:

1. Data Structures: This folder contains all of my programs that emphasize creating and using data structures.
2. COSC 2325: Contains programs that were coded in the assembly language MIPS.
3. PDF Reader: Converts the PDF files in the Research Paper folder from PDFs to text files.
4. Craig.com: An information retrieval system that determines the similarity of two documents.
5. Tripshare Database: Contains all of the necessary diagrams to design the database and the SQL file for it. The database was coded using MySQL.
6. Sprout: An interactive web platform powered by React and Next.js, designed to educate users about gardening and assist in planning personalized gardens. This project won first runner-up at the Spring 2025 Capstone fair at UT Tyler.
