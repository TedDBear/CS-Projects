It realizes thecorrelation between real images and models and theintegration of dynamic image synthesis, seamless imageediting, and other process links to obtain virtual images.Film and television postproduction based on digital mediatechnology can be regarded as an art form relying on newmediatechnology.Itincludesnotonlytheorganizationand\ncontrol of the formal language of traditional \xef\xac\x81lm and\ntelevision postproduction and traditional media but alsothe\xef\xac\x81lmandtelevisionprocessofdigitalmediatechnology,such as creation, design, application, and communication.Film and television post-production has become a com-prehensive art category integrating art, technology, andhumanities [1]. kQ_his is also the inevitable trend of thesustainable development and evolution of the informationsociety in the Internet era. kQ_he profound impact of thedevelopment of digital media technology on \xef\xac\x81lm andtelevision aesthetics has not only changed the traditional\nway of \xef\xac\x81lm and television production combining digital\nvirtual technology with traditional realism, so as to push\xef\xac\x81lm and television from the original \xe2\x80\x9cjuggling\xe2\x80\x9d scene to aHindawi\nScienti\xef\xac\x81c Programming\nVolume 2022, Article ID 4364834, 7 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/4364834\n'
b'more amazing spectacle for the audience. In the process of\ndeveloping creative forms, the \xef\xac\x81lm also provides the au-dience with a new viewing experience and a new way of\nthinking.

Film and television pro-ductionnolongerexistsasauniquemediaformorarttypeand has graduallybecome theunique spokesman ofdigitalmediatechnologyinthetwenty-\xef\xac\x81rstcentury.Asatechnicalmeans of \xef\xac\x81lm, digital media technology continues to de-velop the interactive function of \xef\xac\x81lm images with theaudience in the process of generation and disseminationand has fully penetrated into various processes of the \xef\xac\x81lmindustry with high-tech means such as 3D, VR, AR, high-\nresolution, and high-frame rate.\nBased on the comprehensive research content, it can be\nseen that the research of digital media technology in the\npostproduction of \xef\xac\x81lm and television is still in the devel-opment stage. kQ_herefore, this paper divides the \xef\xac\x81lm andvideofootage,\xef\xac\x81ndsoutthechangingscenes,andformseachscene according to the color space entropy, motion vector,and motion area. kQ_he bottom feature vector of an image isextracted, and video key frames are extracted based ondigital media technology, pixel label information is estab-lishedinthekeyframes,thefeaturepointsintheforeground\nare removed, and the temporal feature matching points and\nspatial feature matching points in the background areretained to realize dynamic video stitching. Digital mediatechnology in \xef\xac\x81lm and television postproduction is appliedto improve the audience\xe2\x80\x99s viewing experience. kQ_his paperstudies the application of digital media technology in \xef\xac\x81lmand television postproduction, in order to improve theaudience\xe2\x80\x99s viewing experience.\n2.Film and Television Postproduction Method\nBased on Digital Media Technology\n2.1. Video Shot Segmentation. In \xef\xac\x81lm and television post-\nproduction, the video shot needs to be segmented \xef\xac\x81rst. kQ_heboundary between two adjacent shots can be accurately foundin the process of \xef\xac\x81lm and television postproduction. kQ_hisprocess can be regarded as the basis of video processing, and\ntheprocessede\xef\xac\x80ectcanpavethewayforthefollow-up.Before\nandafterthevideoshotswitching,thesceneandtheobjectsinthe scene will generally change.

Lens conversion can beroughly divided into two types, as shown in Table 1.\nAbrupt lens refers to the direct splicing of two lenses at\nthe junction without any transition.
