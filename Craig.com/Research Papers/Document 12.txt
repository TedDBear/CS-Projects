Remarkable face recognition\nalgorithms have been proposed in last decade offering towering\nlevels of accuracy and precision .However, theflexibility and\nrobustnessofthe existin gsystemsremainhighly questionable. To\nfurther intricate these problems, most of the face recognitions\nsystems are designed under strict background constraints,\nconveniently ignoringvariations in illumination and atthe apex of\nthepredicament, liestheintricacy involved in thecreation and\nmaintenance of training sets in the databases. Even the mos t\nsophisticated system sdesignedposedgrave difficulties in\ndeployment and required maintenance by skilled personnel ,\nleading to poorresponse from the glob al market. With an\nobjective to realize an intelligent , maintenance -freesystem with\nimpeccable design,our research team developed an immaculate\nreal-time face recognition system with dynamic training and\nenhanced multi-algorithm face recognition .The system would\nfacilitate user-friendly,dynamic creation of training sets by means\nof an innovative approach whichwould make the need of skilled\nmaintenance personnel obsolete. The proposed system has been\ncomprehensively tested toachieveremarkable precision and\naccuracy of 99.9%. Proposed systemarchetype designwould\nresult in manifold applications in developing simplified face\nrecognition systems (for enrolling masses )forinstitutions,\nbusiness organizations , research labs, military applications, etc.\nfor authentication and authorization purposes.\nCategories and Subject Descriptors\nI.4.9 [IMAGE PROCESSING AND COMPUTER VISION ]:\nApplications\nGeneral Terms\nManagement, Performance, Design, Reliability, Human Factors\nKeywords\nFace, detection, r ecognition, dynamic, training, algorithm, i mage,\nprocessing ,system, real-time,PCA.1.INTRODUCTION\nFace recognition systems have been at the apogee of researchers \xe2\x80\x99\ninterestin thelast few decades ,theprimary purpose being\ndevising simpler methods for recognizing faces .Numerous\nprofound algorithms and approaches have be enproposed and\ndeveloped for face recognition and have obtained outstanding\nresults.However, researchers have continued to beuncertain\naboutthe design of face recognition systems ,which varies based\nonthe environment of deployment and the application. With a\nview to solve this dilemma, our research team modeledareal-time\nface recognition system operational in unknown environment. The\npaper puts forth state -of-the-art design of a novelsystem with\nautomated dynamic trainingset generation usingaspecialized\napproach.A multi-algorithm face detection module was further\nincorporated in the system to achieveremarkable accuracy for\ndetection of faces. Platform independent architecture would\nfacilitate seamless deployment on any computer system, thereby,\nglobalizing the use of the proposed face recognition system.\n2.RELATED WORK\nThe popular approaches for face recognition proposed by prior\nresearches comprise of s kinsegmentation under changing lighting\nconditions ,model based face recognition ,DCT based face\nrecognition ,PCA,feature extraction and many more. Popular\nalgorithms incorporated by such modules include Viola-Jones\nobject detection framework -Viola & Jones (2001),\nSchneiderman & Kan ade(2000),Rowley, Baluja & Kanade:\nNeural Network -based Face Detection (1998),Principal\nComponent Analysis with Eigen Face, Linear Discriminate\nAnalysis, Elastic Bunch Graph Matching fisherface, the Hidden\nMarkov model, and the neuronal motivated dynamic link\nmatching,DCT based faceRecognition , Eigen faces ,et al.\nAlthough extensive research has been carried out to exterminate\ntheflaws in the existingsystemdesign, the highly flexible and\nrobust system is yet to be realized. Furthermore, training se t\ngeneration and maintenance requiresskilledpersonnel but fails to\naccrueimpressive result s.\n3.PROPOSED SYSTEM DESIGN\nThe research team developed an impeccable design of a platform\nindependent, user -friendly face recognition system intended to\noffer maint enance-freerobustfunctionality. The system eradicates\nthe need of skilled personnel for training set generation by\nconstructing its training set databases using a specialized\nautomated approach. Once the training sets are built, the system\nuses combinati on ofdifferent approaches for face recognition\nprevalent today.

b'International Conference and Workshop on Emerging Trends in T echnology (ICWET 2011) \xe2\x80\x93TCET, Mumbai, India\n120recognition system shall be segregated into two procedures as\nfollows:\n3.1Automated Run -Time Training Set\nGeneration for Enrolment\nThetraining set is builtdynamically to improve efficiency , user-\nfriendliness and robustness of thesystem.For enrolment of each\nuser, a short duration specialized video is captured and used for\ntraining purpose.\n3.1.1Innovative Training S et Generation Technique :\nThe training set o f every individual is created in a specialized\nmanner in which frames are captured by the camera while the face\nis rotated about a vertical axis passing through the center of\nfrontal face .For enrolment, each user is only instructed to orient\nhis/her head perpendicular to the axis of the capturing camera and\nrotate the face from right to leftend.In simpler words, the user\nmaintaining an erect posture, must gaze directly and straight\nforward into the camera and turn face from right to left end. The\ncameramust be preferably positioned such that its axis passes\nthrough the center of the face and is perpendicular to the reference\naxis shown in Figure 1. In this manner , numerous training images of userface in all possible orientations about vertical axis are obtained; This makes the training set self -reliant to recognize the face in almost all possible orientations .Figure1illustrates the\nreference axis considered with respect to the frontal face of a user.\nFigure1.Reference axis with respect to fron tal face\n3.1.2Capturing the Specialized Training V ideo:\nThis process involves obtaining ashort duration real-timevideo\ncapturedbyvideo captur ingdevice like astandardweb cam for\xe2\x80\x98t\xe2\x80\x99\nseconds which is depend anton the frame rate . At a constant frame\nrate of\xe2\x80\x98r\xe2\x80\x99 fps,total of (tx r) frames are captured.These frames are\nsegregated to obtain \xe2\x80\x98m\xe2\x80\x99 frames (where m=t x r). Each video\nframe is enhanced using contrast stretching technique for image\nprocessing. The video capture may furtherbe carried out against\nany unknown, random, non -plain, changing background\nenvironment by use of skin segmentation techniques. Figure2\nillustrates samples of video frames captured for \xe2\x80\x98t\xe2\x80\x99seconds.\nFrame1          Frame 12         Fr ame 27 Frame 38\nFrame 49 Frame 63         Frame 78         Frame 93\nFrame 112       Frame 123        Frame 132        Frame 143\nFigure2.Video frames captured using specialized approach\n3.1.3Face Detection:\nNext, face detection is performed on each of the enhanced video\nframes[1][2][11]. This step is essential to verify the existence of a\ndetectable face in each of the video frames. A video frame may\nhave face oriented in an angle incomprehensible for face\ndetection, may be subjected to extreme variation i n illumination\nor may not contain a face at all. Such images if stored in the\ntraining set would act as redundant bulk data unnecessarily\nincreasing the system load. There fore,by using face detection\nusing skin segmentation technique on individual frames, such\ninsignificant frames are discarded to obtain \xe2\x80\x98n\xe2\x80\x99 resultant frames.\n3.1.4Feature Extraction and Updating the Training\nSet Databases\nThe training is performed by the means of these final \xe2\x80\x98n\xe2\x80\x99 frames,\nout of the initial \xe2\x80\x98m\xe2\x80\x99 frames captured. The system provide s scope\nfor either dynamically creating the training images for the training\nsets in the database or to pre -train the databases using feature\nextraction and model based approach [6][10]. Considering the\nuser preference and system performance requirements, suitable\naction is taken. Either the \xe2\x80\x98n\xe2\x80\x99 extracted frames are dynamically\nsaved to a directory on local hard -drive and logged with the name\nof user in the captured image or the database is pre -trained,\nresulting into dynamic creation of template finally sa ved onto the\nhard-drive, which concludes the training procedure. Pre -training\nthe databases offers lesser response time during recognition phase\nin contrast to simply saving the training images into training sets.\n3.1.5Framework for E nrolment Procedure\nAs evident from the processing steps for enrolment, the system\nfacilitates automated training set generation in a hassle -free\nmanner without the need of any expert assistance. Consequently,\nit is no longer required to recruit trained personnel for enrolment\nand maintenance purposes thereby making the system easy to use\nand user friendly. Moreover, by capturing all possible face angles\nof an individual, the training set thus constructed is robust,\npowerful and very effective for face recognition.'
