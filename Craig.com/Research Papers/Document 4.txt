b'38 X. Zou et al.\n1 Introduction\nRecently Long suggested a new type of quantum computers called duality computers\nor duality quantum computers [ 1]. The latest development of the duality computer\ntheory can be found in Long\xe2\x80\x99s review article [ 2]. The duality computers based on the\ngeneral quantum interference principle is much more powerful than an ordinary quan-tum computer. Compared to an ordinary quantum computer, the duality computers are\na moving quantum computer passing through a multi-slit. In a duality computer, there\nexist two new computing gates, the quantum wave divider (QWD) and the quantumwave combiner (QWC), in addition to the usual universal gates for quantum comput-\ners. A quantum wave can be divided by QWD and recombined by QWC. The duality\ncomputers offer the capability to perform separate operations on the subwaves coming\nout of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. This enables us to perform\ncomputation using not only unitary operations, but also linear combinations of unitaryoperations.\nBecause a duality computer is more powerful than an ordinary quantum computer,\nit is interesting to many scholars. Many researchers have investigated its mathemati-cal theory and discussed its application [ 2\xe2\x80\x9311]. First, Gudder gave the mathematical\ntheory for the duality computers [ 3]. He provided two descriptions for the mathe-\nmatical theory of the duality computers. One is in the pure state formalism and theother is in the mixed state formalism. Also, he pointed out that a paradoxical situa-\ntion occurs between the mixed state formalism and the pure state formalism. Then,\nto solve the paradox, Long gave the mathematical theory of the duality computers in thedensity matrix formalism which is in accordance with Gudder\xe2\x80\x99s pure state\ndescription [ 4].\nThough the advantage of the duality computers, such as \xe2\x80\x9cunsorted database search\nproblem may be solved by using only a single query\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9call NP-complete prob-\nlems may have polynomial algorithms\xe2\x80\x9d in the duality computers, is lost in Gudder\xe2\x80\x99s\nmathematical theory for the mixed state formalism, there exits other merit in the\nmathematical theory for mixed state formalism pointed out by Gudder [ 3]. The math-\nematical theory for the mixed state formalism has been studied by some researchers[5\xe2\x80\x937]. In this paper, we argue for Gudder mathematical theory for the mixed state formalism. First, we point out some problems existing in Gudder\xe2\x80\x99s pure state descriptionof the mathematical theory of the duality computers. Then, to solve the paradox in Ref.\n[3], we construct a new mathematical theory of the duality computers in the pure state\nformalism according with Gudder\xe2\x80\x99s mixed state description. The new mathematicaltheory can conquer the problems mentioned above. Finally, we point out that, based\non our mathematical theory, nonunitary operations can be performed in every path of\na QWD of the duality computers.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we point out some problems existing\nin Gudder\xe2\x80\x99s pure state description of the duality computers. In Sect. 3, we construct a\nnew mathematical theory of the duality computers in the pure state formalism accord-ing with Gudder\xe2\x80\x99s mixed state description. In Sect. 4, we discuss other operations\nin addition to the unitary operations. The last section summarizes our work in this\npaper.\n123'
