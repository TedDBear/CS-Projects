Offshore development faces additional challenges, such\nas trust, communication and coordination, and socio-cultural and knowledge transfer. There is a\nneed to determine the rankings of challenges considering their criticality concerning practitioners\nworking in agile-based offshore software development. This paper aims to identify and rank agile\nchallenges in offshore software development by applying computational intelligence techniques.\nFrom the systematic literature review, we identi\xef\xac\x81ed 30 communication and coordination challenges.\nThe distributed agile pattern catalog consists of 15 patterns, from which eight were used to solve\ncommunication and collaboration challenges. Many researchers have used fuzzy logic to quantify\ntheir results. We further applied the fuzzy analytical technique to determine the priority order\nconcerning the criticality of the identi\xef\xac\x81ed agile pattern catalog. The results showed that Central\nCode Repository Pattern ranked the most signi\xef\xac\x81cant for solving communication and coordination\nchallenges. Global Scrum Board Pattern and Synchronous Communication Pattern ranked second.\nKeywords: agile software development; global software development; fuzzy sets; distributed agile\npatterns; computational intelligence\nMSC: 03B52\n1. Introduction\nGlobalization is progressively taking the IT world. It has affected how software\ncompanies do business globally. Software companies adopted the concept of offshore\ndevelopment to gain \xef\xac\x81nancial bene\xef\xac\x81ts by transferring work to low cost labor forces [ 1].\nDue to the cutting down of costs many companies are opting to offshore their work. Cost\nreduction has always been the core reason to offshore but there are other advantages too\nsuch as access to skilled resources and proximity to markets and customers [ 2,3]. However,\nwhen a team is distributed in offshore ventures, it is often divided by major differences\nin time, geography, values and business cultures. Trust, socio-cultural, communication,\ncoordination, and knowledge transfer issues emerge as a result [ 4]. These problems create\nobstacles for distributed teams, and has an impact on the applicability of agile-based\noffshore software development, which relies heavily on face-to-face communication [5\xe2\x80\x937].\nAgile Software Development focuses on customer collaboration, changing needs,\nindividual interactions, and continual delivery of working software. Global Software\nDevelopment using Agile has bene\xef\xac\x81ts but it is not a straightforward process, as now\nthe teams are distributed among distinct locations and face-to-face communication is\ncurtailed [ 8]. To overcome the issues mentioned above, several teams have tried to adapt\nAxioms 2023 ,12, 307. https://doi.org/10.3390/axioms12030307 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/axioms'

As distributed agile development involves more complicated uncertainties due to\nunpredictable ambiguities, probability theory and statistics were used to address the un-\ncertainty. However, in daily situations, natural language is exercised to express thinking\nand subjective perceptions. In natural language, words might not convey clear meaning.\nIndividual expressions about an event may use the same words but have different sub-\njective perceptions. To tackle this problem, fuzzy set theory is used to express linguistic\nvariables more appropriately [ 9,10]. Fuzzy logic has been used to evaluate agile methods\nand practices [ 11]. Researchers have used fuzzy logic to explore different aspects of agile,\nsuch as requirement estimation, risk assessment, and agility evaluation. In this paper, fuzzy logic is used to validate the use of the Distributed Agile Patterns Catalog.\nWork has been done on distributed agile development but has only focused on either\ntrust [ 12] or on communication with remote customers [ 13]. CMMI [ 14] and Blockchain [ 15]\nhas also been used to propose solutions in distributed development, but the work has\nfocused on maturity levels and Ethereum blockchain to execute smart contracts for payment\ndistribution. This research focused on solving the 30 communication and coordination\nchallenges that occur in distributed agile development by applying the Distributed Agile\nPattern Catalog with the utilization of fuzzy logic.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the important related research\nin communication and coordination. Section 3 presents the research methodology used in\nthis research. Section 4 presents the Distributed Agile Patterns and Section 5 explains the\napplication of fuzzy logic to evaluate the usefulness of agile patterns. Section 6 discusses\nthe \xef\xac\x81ndings of the paper. Section 7 describes the threat to validity and Section 8 provides\nthe conclusion of the paper, including the theoretical and practical contributions of the\nproposed study.\n2. Related Work\nGlobal Software Development (GSD) is a trend that is only just starting to gain mo-\nmentum and appeals to businesses all around the world. It unites different partners from\nseveral nations and cultures to access a vast labor pool. As new businesses go global to\nreduce their costs, there are unique challenges associated with GSD [ 16,17]. Among them\nare the diversity of sourcing and the complexity of communication and coordination that\nare required to prevent global project failure [ 18,19]. Agile software development in a\ndistributed scenario is challenging. Study has been done to investigate the impact of the\nagile framework on IT sourcing and to identify the dimensions of ITS affected by agile\nframeworks [ 20]. Some companies use product line engineering methods to shorten their\nrelease cycles for distributed agile projects. These changes result in reducing the risks due to\ncommunication and coordination, as well as help in sharing knowledge across the team [ 21].\nWork has also been done on the use of technology in distributed development [ 22\xe2\x80\x9324].\nAccording to the authors if we carefully select technology and allow members to participate,\nirrespective of their location, we can have ef\xef\xac\x81cient distributed development.\nChallenges such as trust, communication and coordination, socio-cultural, and knowl-\nedge transfer issues, occur due to temporal, geographical and socio-cultural distance\naffecting communication and coordination in offshoring. Conchuir et al. mapped op-\nportunities and challenges of global software development in terms of communication,\ncoordination, and control. It was seen that increase in distance resulted in an increased\ncost of communication and coordination, and was highly dependent on synchronous tools,\nwhich could result in misunderstandings [25].\nGhani et al. mapped how distance related to dif\xef\xac\x81culties in coordination and commu-\nnication in a systematic literature review [ 26]. It was shown that physical distance con-\ntributed to 35% of challenges to communication and coordination, and temporal distracts\ncontributed to 28%, socio-cultural to 22%, and knowledge experience to 4%.
