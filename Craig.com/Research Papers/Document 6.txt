In this paper, we formulate medical decision making as a classification problem and develop a moment kernel machine (MKM) to tackle these challenges. The main idea of \nour approach is to treat the clinical data of each patient as a probability distribution and leverage \nmoment representations of these distributions to build the MKM, which transforms the high\xe2\x80\x91\ndimensional clinical data to low\xe2\x80\x91dimensional representations while retaining essential information. \nWe then apply this machine to various pre\xe2\x80\x91surgical clinical datasets to predict surgical outcomes and \ninform medical decision making, which requires significantly less computational power and time for \nclassification while yielding favorable performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, we \nutilize synthetic datasets to demonstrate that the developed moment \xe2\x80\x91based data mining framework \nis robust to noise and missing data, and achieves model parsimony giving an efficient way to generate \nsatisfactory predictions to aid personalized medical decision making.\nSurgery, as a major medical intervention, is usually considered when other treatments result in unsatisfactory \noutcomes. Predicting adverse events following surgery based on patients\xe2\x80\x99 presurgical clinical data such as elec-\ntronic health record (EHR) data is of crucial importance to inform both physicians and patients for decision \n making1,2. In recent years, the increased availability of clinical data and computing power greatly stimulated \nthe development of machine learning (ML) techniques to extract information from clinical data. In particular, \nML algorithms have made significant strides in AI-assisted medical procedures for preoperative prediction of \npostsurgical outcomes through  EHRs3,4. The general ML problem focuses on finding an appropriate function f \nmapping each input data point X to the desired output y , i.e.,\nThis task is particularly challenging for datasets containing clinical records with a large size and mixed types of \ndata, including diagnoses, treatments, vital signs, and laboratory  values5.\nIn the past decade, numerous ML-aided methods have been proposed to assist medical decision making \nthrough the prediction of postsurgical events. For example, for weight-loss surgery, notable contributions include \nthe application of logistic regression (LR) and Poisson regression (PR) to estimate the readmission  rate6, the \nutilization of neural networks (NNs) and gradient-boosting machines (GBMs) to predict gastrointestinal leak \nand venous  thromboembolism7,8, and the development of the super learner algorithm to predict the risk of \n30-day readmission after bariatric  surgery9,10. In addition to assessing possible postsurgical events, ML methods \nhave been widely applied to identify abnormalities in medical images such as precancerous or premalignant \n lesions11\xe2\x80\x9314. Primary examples range from a deep learning approach to mortality prediction for patients with \ncoronary heart disease and heart  failure15 to quantitative image feature extraction methods for the prognosis of \nearly revascularization in patients with suspected coronary artery  disease16. Algorithmically, deep neural net-\nworks have been attractive to medical researchers and practitioners, due to their ability to discover hidden struc -\ntures in large datasets, leading to a high probability of achieving satisfactory results under suitable  conditions17. \nAmong these works, the integration of ML-techniques into medical research, although successful in many ways, \nusually suffers from low computational efficiency due to the heterogeneous structure, e.g., due to sparsity and (1) y= f(X).OPEN\n1Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, \nUSA. 2Division of Computational and Data Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, \nUSA. 3Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, \nUSA. 4Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, \nSt. Louis, MO 63110, USA. *email: jsli@wustl.edu ; chang.su-hsin@wustl.edu'

In general, the complexity of ML algorithms grow exponentially \nin time and memory usage as a function of data size. Moreover, to produce better performance, deep neural \nnetworks further sacrifice robustness to noise and model parsimony, in addition to computational  efficiency19.\nAiming to construct a parsimonious and computationally efficient model to assist medical decision making, \nparticularly for surgical treatments, we develop a moment kernel machine  for clinical data mining. The main idea \nis to introduce the notion of moments for clinical data to efficiently characterize patients\xe2\x80\x99 overall health status. We \nfurther integrate the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) Lasso method into the data preprocessing \nprocedure. This leads to two major advantages: (1) the moment representation can quantitatively identify the \ncrucial predictors impacting surgery outcomes; and (2) the dimension of the EHR data is significantly reduced, \nwhich facilitates its high computational efficiency in data analytic tasks. We then formulate medical decision \nmaking problems as ML classification problems, in which the moment representations extracted from EHR data \nare used as features for ML classifiers. To demonstrate, we choose three ML classifiers, LR, NNs, and GBMs, \nand used three clinical datasets to illustrate the generalizability of the developed moment kernel machine, that \nis, making medical decisions based on moments is valid for different clinical data regardless of the choices of \nthe ML classifiers. We compare the classification performance resulting from our method with that from\xc2\xa0exist -\ning feature extraction methods, highlighting the model parsimony and high computational efficiency of the \ndeveloped moment kernel machine. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of moment kernel machine \nto noise and data loss using synthetic data.\nMethods\nIn this section, we first illustrate how clinical decision making can be assisted through machine learning algo -\nrithms to give informed predictions based on the patient\xe2\x80\x99s clinical data. In particular, we formulate this task as \na classification problem. Next, as the core of this section, we develop a novel moment kernel to extract features \nfrom the clinical data for the classification problem. Our method\xc2\xa0uniquely integrates the HSIC Lasso algorithm \nto select informative features, thereby improving computational efficiency without sacrificing classification per -\nformance. To demonstrate the applicability of the developed medical decision making machine, we also present \ncase studies using both synthetic data and real clinical data.\nEvent prediction as classification problems. Making decisions regarding a major medical intervention \nfor a patient, e.g., deciding whether the patient should have surgery, generally requires (1) collecting sufficient \ndata on possible post-intervention outcomes; (2) monitoring the current health condition and reviewing the \nmedical history of the patient; and (3) assessing the significant factors influencing the possible outcomes based \non the patient\xe2\x80\x99s current health condition and medical history. This pipeline closely follows the formulation of \na classification task in machine learning, where each class represents one possible post-intervention outcome. \nThen, the classification outcome obtained by the ML procedure using the patient\xe2\x80\x99s clinical data can inform the \nmedical decision.\nIn ML, features play a critical role in its performance. To ably assist with the medical decision making process, \nit is crucial to extract features from clinical data which reflect the patients\xe2\x80\x99 medical conditions as well as ones \nthat affect post-intervention outcomes, which is the main focus of the following sections.\nMoment kernel for clinical data. When working with datasets comprising both numerical and categori-\ncal values, we apply one-hot  encoding20, a technique that converts categorical predictors to non-negative binary \nvalues. Each category is given a unique numerical representation as a feature vector consisting of entries of 0 \nand 1. We then pre-normalize each feature (predictor) within the training and testing datasets to ensure that all \nof them are in the interval [0,\xc2\xa01] before further normalizing the predictor vector of each patient to a probability \ndistribution. Let xi=(xi1,...,xiM) denote the predictor vector of the ith patient for i=1,...,N , where N is the \ntotal number of patients and M is the number of predictors for each patient, then we normalize each xj as\nwhich yields a vector pi=(pi1,...,piM) satisfying \xe2\x88\x91M\nj=1pij=1 . In addition, every component pij of pi takes \nvalues in the same interval [0,\xc2\xa01], and this resolves any heterogeneity in the data, that is, different components of \nthe predictor vector xi are drawn from different ranges. The property \xe2\x88\x91M\nj=1pij=1 then reveals that pi is a prob-\nability vector, and hence each pi represents the probability distribution of some random variable A . In particular, \nif A takes values on the set \xef\xbf\xbd={\xce\xb11,...,\xce\xb1M} containing M  distinct elements, then the probability of the event \n{A=\xce\xb1j} is given by P(A=\xce\xb1j)=pij for each j=1,...,M.\nBy the Hausdorff moment  problem21, the probability distribution pi of A is uniquely determined by the \nmoment vector  mi=(mi0,...,mi,M\xe2\x88\x921)\xe2\x88\x88RM , whose kth-component is given by\nand referred to as the kth-moment  of the random variable A with respect to the probability distribution pi . Com -\nputationally, the moment vector m i can be easily obtained by m i=piM , where(2)pij=xij\xe2\x88\x91M\nj=1xij,\n(3) mik=E(Ak)=M\xe2\x88\x91\nj=1\xce\xb1k\njpij,'
