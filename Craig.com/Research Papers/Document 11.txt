In literature, multi resolution analyses of image through wavelet and Gabor transfor m have been quite exploited \nsuccessfully for pattern recognition and so far, for face recognition. In contrast to wavele t transform, curvelet transform \nvery efficiently approximate the curved edges with very few coefficients in addition to sp ace-frequency information. Edges \ninformation is very important to pattern recognition task in image, hence for face recognition.   Various statistical features from curvelet coefficient  have used and evaluated with Indian face dataset of IIT Kanpur having 60 multi-pose different objects,  \nusing machine learning approach. The results achieved are very promising with 92.0 % accuracy for 500 images. Some popular existing methods based on wavelet transform are also evaluated for comparison in this study.   \nCategories and Subject Descriptors  \nI.4.8 [Image Processing and Computer Vision ]: Scene \nAnalysis- Object recognition . \nGeneral Terms  \nPerformance, Design. \nKeywords  \nCurvelet Transform (CT), Wavelet Transform, Face Recognition \n1. INTRODUCTION \nFace recognition is one of the prime application of biometric identification received significant attention in areas such as computer vision and surveillance. This is used in many other applications like human computer interaction (HCI), image retrieval and security systems. The objective of face recognition system is to identify persons by their facial images. The application of curvelet coefficients in face recognition started only in last few years. \n The recognition process includes comparison the features of \nimages with a set of valid refere nce features already enrolled with \nthe system. The simplified model of face recognition system is illustrated in figure 1. Feature extraction is very important task in face recognition system as the success of this kind of systems is depends on the robust features ex tracted from images. Curvelet \nTransform is relatively new appr oach used in multi-scale image \nanalysis. In recent year curvelet transform has been used successfully in pattern recognition problems specially in image processing [1, 2]. \nA lot of research work already done in the area of face \nrecognition. Classical techni ques are Principal Component \nAnalysis (PCA) [3, 4] and Linear  Discriminate Analysis (LDA) \n[5, 6]; however PCA based system having good performance in face recognition. Curvelet Transform is relatively new approach used in face recognition. \n \n \nFigure 1.

b' \n240 In this paper we proposed a robust face recognition system based \non multi-scale analysis. The Curvel et Transform is applied to \ndecompose the input image in orde r to get curvelet coefficient. \nThe curvelet features for each input image are obtained from 4th and 6th level curvelet coeffici ents. Min-max algorithm has been \nused for feature set normalization in order to improve the recognition accuracy. Then simila rity between the extracted \nfeatures and a set of reference features is calculated by means of K-NN classifier. IIT Kanpur face dataset is used to evaluate the proposed system for face recognition. The results obtained from proposed system are very promising. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: review of curvelet \ntransform is given in section II.  Feature extraction approach is \ndescribed in Section III. Proposed approach is presented in Section IV. Experiment results are discussed in section V and \nconcluding remarks are given in section VI. \n2. CURVELET TRANSFORM \nThe Curvelet transform is a highe r dimensional generalization of \nthe Wavelet transform designed to represent images at different \nscales and different angles [7]. The benefit of using Curvelet transform is that curved singularities can be well approximated with very few coefficients and in a non-adaptive manner [7]. Curvelet transform is extension of the wavelet concept [8]. The limitation of wavelet transform is th at it fails to represents objects \ncontaining randomly oriented edges and curves as it is not good at representing line singularities [9]. The curvelet transform is able to catch the edge singularities efficiently. Fig.2 shows the curvelet construction. \nAlgorithm for finding the curvelet coefficients: STEP1: Take the Fourier transform of the signal STEP2: Divide the frequency plai n into polar wedges (as shown \nin fig.2) STEP3: Find the curvelet coefficients at a particular scale (j) and \nangle (\xce\xb8) by taking the inverse FFT of each wedge at scale j and \noriented at angle \xce\xb8.  \nDiscrete curvelet coefficient can be given by the equation-1taken from [10]  \n] , [ ] , [ ) , , , (2,1, ,\n002 1 n m n m f k k l j CD\nk k l j\nN nM mD\xef\x81\xaa \xef\x83\xa5\xef\x80\xbd\n\xef\x82\xa3\xef\x82\xa3\n\xef\x81\xb0\xef\x81\xb0        (1) \nHere ] , [2,1, , n mD\nk k l j\xef\x81\xaa is digital curvelet transform. jis scale, l is \norientation and ) , (2 1k k are location parameters.  \nThe discrete curvelet transform can be applied using two \nalgorithms namely Unequispaced FFT transform and Wrapping transform. In unequispaced Fast Fourier transform, the curvelet coefficients are formed by irregularly sampling the Fourier coefficients of the image. In wrapping algorithm, curvelet coefficients are formed by using a series of translations and a wraparound technique. The performance of wrapping based algorithm is fast in computation and more robust as compare to USFFT however both algorithms give the same output. Therefore we have used wrapping based algorithm to find out curvelet \ncoefficients. Figure2 shows curvelets in frequency as well as spatial domain. The shaded area is one of the wedge. The wedges are formed by dividing the frequency plane into different partitions and the spatial plane is divided in respect to \xce\xb8 (angular \ndivision). The angular division divides each subband image into different angles. \n \n \nFigure 2. Curvelets in frequency domain (left) and spatial \ndomain (Right) \n \n3. FEATURE EXTRACTION \nThe performance of the face recognition system depends upon the \nfeatures extracted from images. The features should have high \nintraclass similarity and low interclass similarity. In our system discrete curvelet transform (4th and 6th level) is used to extract features from images. The feature vector obtained from curvelet coefficients provides multi-scale representation. To extract the \ncurvelet coefficients we applied fast discrete curvelet transform to images with 4th and 6th level d ecomposition using Curvelab-2.1.2 \n[11]. We used only basic softwa re of Curvelab and further \nmodifications are done by us. \nThe curvelet coefficients are extracted using the discrete curvelet \ntransform. The input image is tran sfered into Fourier domain first \nthen the convolution of the curvel et with the image in spatial \ndomain becomes the product in Fourier domain [10]. Finally we applied inverse Fourier transform on spectral product in order to obtain curvelet coefficients. But due to the frequency response of \na curvelet is a nonrectangular wedge; the wedge needs to be wrapped into a rectangle to perform  the inverse Fourier transform. \nThe wrapping is done by periodic tiling of the spectrum using the wedge, and then collecting the rectangular coefficient area in the centre. Through this periodic tiling, the rectangular region collects the wedge\xe2\x80\x99s corresponding portions from the surrounding periodic wedges.  \nThe mean and standard deviation from each subband are \ncalculated to obtain features form curvelet coefficients. The features are extracted from each im age. The curvelet features of \ninput image are computed as shown in figure 4 then the \ncomparison between query feature and set of reference features done using Euclidean distance through K-NN classifier.
