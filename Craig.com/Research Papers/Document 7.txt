Gen Z is characterized by teamwork in cyberspace and solving pro blems. Gen Z can also \nadopt artificial intelligence (AI) technology as their learning tool. Meanwhile, Gen Z faces the \nchallenge of acquiring 21st -century skills requiring higher -order thinking (HOTS). This paper will \nfocus on learning skills, especially c ritical thinking (CT). For this reason, it is essential to improve \nthe competency of CT skills in Gen Z by using a model that combines the 7E learning cycle with \npeeragogy learning approach and adopting the latest AI applications as a tool. This model will  \ncontribute to the theoretical and practical use of AI apps for education, particularly the role of \ncorrect utilization of AI. Additionally, it can be misused to improve learning skills, especially CT \nskills. The results carried out in class show AI's effe ctiveness in improving CT skills for Gen Z, \nespecially the role of AI in the back-end learning process, namely to verify and validate understanding.  \nThis paper suggests that AI apps should be controlled if used in the front -end learning process, \nespecially  at the exploration stage, to improve CT skills. Without controlling the AI apps, they can \nreduce learners' ability to explore a topic according to their creativity and criticality.   \n \nKeywords:  Innovation in learning, critical thinking, Generation Z , peeragogy, Artificial Intelligence . \n \n \nIntroduction  \n \nTechnological innovation is part of a process that is in harmony with the progress of human civilization. Humans \nconstantly innovate to be able to make their lives better. Therefore, technology plays a significant role in helping \nhuman activities, includin g but not limited to the teaching and learning process. The technological innovations \ncreated by humankind have developed in unprecedented forms. More technological innovations are based on \ninformation technology (IT) and digital technology. This developme nt has influenced many aspects of society's \nlife today, known as Society 5.0, namely a society that lives side by side with intelligent and sophisticated \ntechnology . \n \nCurrently, the use of IT, digital, and social media has made people's way of life differe nt from before, including \nlearning, because distance is no longer a barrier for people to learn. The current generation, generation Z, known \nas Gen Z, is a generation that lives side by side with this technology daily. Gen Z is very familiar with and seems  \ndependent on this technology, so it is not surprising that it is called a digital native  [1]. However, the digital \nfamiliarity of Gen Z does not indicate a high ability to learn skills, especially critical thinking skills (CT skills)  \n[2]. Therefore, Gen Z needs to use their strength in digital familiarity to improve their learning skills and better \nface the challenges of the 21st century . \n \nTo face these challenges, Gen Z must have 21st -century skill competencies categorized into learning, literacy, and life skills. This paper will describe the 4C learning skills: critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and \ncommunication  [3]\xe2\x80\x93[5]. Critical thinking (CT) skills will be the main focus of this paper because they are \nconsidered essential skills for Gen Z  [3]\xe2\x80\x93[5]. CT skills, among others, are a part of higher -order  thinking skills \n(HOTS), which, are still ranked relatively low in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA)  [2]. "
b"Baskoro  et al./ Innovation to improve critical thinking skills in Generation Z  / JTI, Vol. 25, No. 2., December 20 23, pp.121-130 \n122 Efforts related to improving CT skills have been carried out in several studies using various methods. However, \nimproving CT skills specifically aimed at Gen Z with its unique characteristics is still necessary in the current \nconditions. Therefore, this pa per aims to elaborate on a method to improve Gen Z competence in CT skills that \nare in tune with Gen Z\xe2\x80\x99s characteristics and utilize peeragogy approaches combined with artificial intelligence \n(AI). This paper not only discusses the use of AI in education, such as to improve CT skills but also provides \nawareness regarding the possible impacts of using AI unthinkingly, which can have ethical implications  [6]. \n \nMethod s \nThe methodology used in this paper is a literature study that is directly related to the topic. In addition, this \npaper also develops a method to achieve the objective. The method is to adopt 7E learning cycles and peeragogy \nas a learning approach combined  with using artificial intelligence/AI as a tool (Figure 1). Another methodology \nused in this paper is action research, where this method is applied directly to the teac hing and learning process in the classroom at a higher education institution . \n \n \nFigure 1. Method to achieve competence of critical t hinking  \n \nGeneration  \n \nGenerations represent a distinct and separate group of people with a standard set of beliefs, experiences, and \nvalues about how the world works. Generations are individuals who live in the same period and have the same \nage, year of birth, and similar events in the lives of these individual groups  [7]. In the characterization of \ngenerations based on the year of birth, according to Tracy Francis and Fernanda Hoefel  [8], at least we already \nknow some of them: Baby boomers (1940 -1959), Gen X (1960 -1979), Gen Y/Millennial (1980 -1994), Gen Z (1995 -\n2010). There are several characteristics of each of these generations, the most prominent being mastery of IT, internet, use of gadgets, and active use of social media such as SMS, email, BBM, WhatsApp, Line, Facebook, Instagram, online applications, etc . [9]\xe2\x80\x93[14]. \n \nGeneration Z (Gen Z)  \n \nIn this paper, we will specifically discuss Gen Z, born between 1995 and 2010 and currently aged between 13 and 28. This generation was born when IT and digital technology i nnovation and development experienced \nmuch progress. Not surprisingly, they were born and developed in a social environment heavily influenced by \nIT technology's use in everyday life. Due to the influence of environmental developments, including but not \nlimited to technology, this generation has specific characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses compared to other \ngenerations. Generation Z is also known in many references with other terms such as iGeneration, net generation  \nor internet generation, post -millennials, Facebook generation, digital natives, switchers, dotcom children, C -\nconnection \xe2\x80\x93generation, D -digital \xe2\x80\x93generation, and R -responsibility \xe2\x80\x93generation . \n \nCharacteristics of Generation Z  \n \nSome of the distinctive characteristics of Gen Z, as conveyed by Singh and Dangmei  [9] among others, are tend \nto be impatient, have an instant way of thinking, lack ambition, have symptoms of ADHD (Attention Deficit \nHyperactivity Disorder), especially attention deficit with high dependence on technology, individualistic, self -\n"
